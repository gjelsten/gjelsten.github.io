      <div class="card">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dreams of Aurora ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and privacy. Most importantly, <strong>Dreams of Aurora does not collect, store, or transmit any information about its users.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Dreams of Aurora is designed with privacy as a core principle. The App operates entirely on your device and does not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collect any personal information</li>
          <li>Store any user data</li>
          <li>Transmit any information to external servers</li>
          <li>Track your usage or behavior</li>
          <li>Access your contacts, location, or other device data</li>
          <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
          <li>Share data with third parties</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All app functionality, including story playback and preferences, is stored locally on your device only.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
        <p>Any preferences or settings you configure within the App (such as story selections or playback settings) are stored locally on your device. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>4. No Internet Connection Required</h2>
        <p>Dreams of Aurora is designed to work offline. While the App may require an internet connection for initial download and updates, it does not require an active internet connection to function, and it does not communicate with any external servers during normal use.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Dreams of Aurora does not collect any information from anyone, including children. Since we do not collect data, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under any age.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Dreams of Aurora does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect or process your data. The App operates independently without any external data processing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store any of your data, there is no data for us to delete. If you delete the App from your device, all locally stored preferences will be removed along with the App.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date." Since we do not collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes, but we encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since Dreams of Aurora does not collect any information about you, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. Your privacy is protected by design—the App simply cannot collect your information because it is not built to do so.</p>
      </div>
